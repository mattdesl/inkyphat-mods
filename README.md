Python source code dump for my inkyPHAT experiments.

This is just the python code, not the JS generative art code. See `./src/gallery.py` which fetches new images from a 'gallery server' (i.e. written in Python, Node.js or another platform) that responds with images.

Perhaps at some point I will go through and clean all of this up into a coherent example/test, until then you'll have to dig through and glue it all together on your own!
